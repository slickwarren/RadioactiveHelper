# RadioactiveHelper
A tool working in conjunction with PYne to determine possible radioactive elements in a given gamma sample.

PYne can install directions can be found here:http://pyne.io/install/index.html

The code can be found in midtermMain.py which was the final project for my Computational Nuclear Engineering course in college.  This code is meant to help physicists determine which element(s) are possibly in a spectrum of gamma rays (data from a detector).  

Current features include: 
Efficiency Adjustment for (Germanium Detector Only)
prediction of a 'light' element, 'heavy' element, and a 'lab' element
sample data from 'charred banana' experiment... predicts that potassium 40 is the likely radioactive element in this sample

Future works include:
Adding efficiency adjustment for any detector
Testing a wider variety of spectra
Calculating the background subtraction for the user, instead of the user having to enter the data already background subtracted
Add user functionality (i.e. make executable)
